Roll the dice is a desktop-only small (offline) game.
Two players can play it.

Rules:
  player can roll the dice and score as many current-points as he/she can but:
      if he/she rolls dice and gets "1" current-points will be zero, and player will be switched.
      if player holds before getting "1", current-points will be added to total score.
  Player who gets 100 points first wins the game.
